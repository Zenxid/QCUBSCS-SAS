                    <p>Thank you for participating in the Fairview University College Application 2025. We would like to inform you that you have been considered as a waitlisted applicant for Freshman Admission at Fairview University. Your admission will be subject to the availability of slots and your evaluated ranking.<br><br>
                    
                    You may have noticed that your application was tagged as "FOR ADVISING." This tag means that the three (3) preferred courses you selected during the admission process are already filled in. Therefore, you must choose from a list of degree programs with available slots.<br><br>
                        
                    Kindly wait for notifications regarding possible remaining slots, which will be sent to you after the confirmation period of First Year students who passed. Please remember to confirm your slot promptly afterward. <b>FAILURE TO CONFIRM MEANS FORFEITURE OF YOUR SLOT.</b><br><br>
                        
                    However, we cannot assure you that a slot will be made available, as waitlisted applicants are prioritized based on their evaluated rank, and there may be few remaining slots for other degree programs. We recommend that you consider your admission options to other higher education institutions as well.<br><br>
                        
                    Thank you for considering Fairview University for your higher education.</p>
